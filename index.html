    <p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.</p>
    <p>Constructed from 1887–89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015.</p>

    <p>The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.</p>
    <p>The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.

<h1><font color="pink">Castle of GoodHope</h1></font>

<img class="img1" src="https://preview.ibb.co/dmCQxc/IMG_20180223_103407.jpg" width="300" height="350">
<p><strong><font color="aqua">The first stone was laid on 2 January 1666 and it was completed by April 1679.
The materials used to build the Castle were local and included rock cut from the granite outcrop on Signal Hill, and blue slate and shells – transported from Robben Island.</p>
  <p>The Castle was built by soldiers, volunteers, slaves and Khoi undergoing punishment. The building housed everything from a church, bakery and living quarters, to various workshops, shops and prison cells, among other facilities.</p>
  <p>The Castle of Good Hope operated as the seat of government of the DEIC until 1795, when the colony was occupied by the British. It served as the official residence of the Governor of the Cape for the first half of the 19th century.
<p>When the governors relocated, the Castle continued to serve as the political center until the Union of South Africa in 1910. In 1917, the Castle was handed over to the South African National Defence Force who still operates the Castle today. In 1936, the Castle was declared a National Monument.</p></font>

<img class="img2" src="http://image.ibb.co/mK4kVx/IMG_20180223_105427.jpg" alt="Iziko" width="300" height="350"><font color="aqua"><p>The Slave Lodge was built in 1679 as the slave lodge of the Dutch East India Company. It is believed that up to 9000 slaves, convicts and the mentally ill lived in the building between 1679 and 1811. The Iziko website The Heritage of Slavery in South Africa gives details of the slave period in the history of the building.</p>
  <p>In 1810 the building was modified to serve as government offices. Various governmental offices were housed in the building during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, for example, the Governor’s Advisory Council, the upper house of the first parliament, The Cape Supreme Court, the first library, the first post office, Deeds Office, and the Women’s Auxiliary Services of the South African Defence Force. The building was restored in 1960 for use as a cultural history museum.</p>
<p>The Slave Lodge, then known as the SA Cultural History Museum, opened its door as a museum on 6 April 1966. The SA Cultural History Museum, originally a division of the SA Museum, became an autonomous museum in 1969. In 1998 the building was renamed the Slave Lodge. In 2000, the museum and its associated sites amalgamated with its parent body as well as the SA National Gallery, the William Fehr Collection and the Michaelis Collection to form Iziko Museums of Cape Town.</p></font>

(He was in 18years on Robben Island prison, 6 years in Pollsmoor and the last 3 at Drakenstein previously known as Victor Verster.)</p><p>The Cape Town City hall situated in Darling Street. This was the 1st Victorian building to be built in Cape Town, some statements say it was the last so quite confusing to which story is to believed. Mayor H Lieberman inaugurated the Cape Town City hall in 1905.
Imported Bath sandstone is showing the wear and tear on front entrance but still stunning.</p><p>In the Grand hall the organ boasts with 3165 pipes and is one of the best in South Africa. The Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra has also been calling this there home for decades.   It is the only concert hall in South Africa that can house a symphony orchestra and a 180 member choir. Princess Elizabeth, now Queen Elizabeth of England held a grand ball here in 1947 to celebrate her 21st birthday.</p></font>
